#  Basic Student Performance Analysis using Python

This project analyzes student performance using fundamental Python programming concepts such as operators, string manipulation, conditionals, loops, and user-defined functions.

üìä The dataset includes math, reading, and writing scores for 1000 students, along with demographic features like gender, race/ethnicity, and parental education levels.


##  Dataset

Dataset Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

##  Objectives

- Calculate average scores and classify students as **Pass** or **Fail**
- Identify the **Topper** and the **Weakest Performer**
- Implement:
  - Arithmetic operations for grades
  - Conditional statements for classification
  - Loops and functions for modular processing
  - Break and continue logic to handle edge cases

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`

## üìå Key Functions Implemented and Result Summary 

```python
def classify_student(avg):  # Classify Pass/Fail
def get_topper(df):         # Identify Topper
def get_weakest(df):        # Identify Weakest
